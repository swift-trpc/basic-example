# `swift-trpc/todo-example`

This example includes files that reflect how swift-trpc could be used to build SwiftUI apps

## Setup

This application uses server from this repository: [todo-example-api](https://github.com/swift-trpc/todo-example-api)

In order to try this application out, you first need to clone the server and start a server using Docker

Then the application should be working fine :)
